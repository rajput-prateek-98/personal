3-> a) To store the records of parts and their respective costing, the most effecient data structure is Hashmap. As we know each part of a vehicle has a unique name which can be used as a key and their respective prices will be the values. This will be the fastest way to access the details of each part of vehicle.
    b) To mark the attendence of students in a class, A 2-D arrray will be very effecient. AS the number of students and the number of working days of a school are fixed or static . In cs eof ststic memeory allocation Arrays are very effective.
    c) CODE:
		def Parser(s:str):
			l_open=['[','{','(']
			l_closed=[']','}',')']
			stack,flag=[],1
			for i in s:
				if i in l_open:
					stack.append(i)
				else:
					id=l_closed.index(i)
					if stack[len(stack)-1]==l_open[id]:
						stack.pop()
					else:
						return False
			if len(stack)==0:
				return True
			else:
				return False
